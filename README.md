# Merge Conflict Homework
I can't seem to figure out how to get it to give me a merge conflict with the instructions we were given.. I seem to follow them exactly and I just keep having everything go smoothly! I even used the command line.. The only way I can think of getting a merge conflict is if I have two branches pulled off of main and have them both change the same line to different things. The after tyring to merge those then I know I would have a problem but it seems that even if I don't push changes and just try to pull them from git hub even after a commit everything goes fine.

# Things learned from designing the page

Honeslty I think using a framework like bootstrap is absolutely the best way to go. It can save so much time when you find the tools that you need! I am really excited to keep developing my page with that. Also, using online resources like codepen and others can be super helpful when trying to accomplish specific things!

Looking at the example was super helpful for seeing real examples on storing data, modifying the DOM, and processing operations in javascript! I thought the code was really well done and I am looking forward to writing more of my own JS!
